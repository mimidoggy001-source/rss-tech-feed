    "summary": "<p>如果说过去几年大模型革命解决的是“机器会不会说话、会不会看图”，那么机器人行业真正的问题是另一层：机器能不能在真实世界里把理解变成行动，并且在长期、重复、带噪声的执行过程中始终稳定可控。</p><p>具身智能的难点从来不在于让机器人做出一次漂亮的demo，而在于让它在换环境、换物体、换硬件、换任务链之后仍然可靠工作。现实中，机器人策略的通用化被三道结构性门槛牢牢卡住。</p><p>第一道门槛是形态割裂。机械臂、夹爪、灵巧手、人形上肢的关节定义与动作空间完全不同，导致数据难以共享，一个模型往往只能绑定一种硬件，换平台就等于重训。</p><p>第二道门槛是数据成本与覆盖。真实机器人数据昂贵、稀缺、分布窄，既难覆盖长程任务，也难覆盖复杂交互，更难支撑跨形态泛化。</p><p>第三道门槛则来自部署系统本身。大量视觉语言动作模型在仿真或离线评估中表现不错，但一上真机就会暴露出控制频率不同步、动作抖动、误差累积、双臂互相干扰等问题，本质上不是模型不聪明，而是缺少面向真实闭环系统的稳定性机制。</p><p>因此，行业在表面上看是在追逐更高的benchmark&nbsp;成功率，但底层竞争其实正",
