    "summary": "<p>“比较幸运的是，我们坚持了最开始相信的事。” 在被问及黑芝麻智能如何在机器人赛道守住先发优势时，黑芝麻智能 CMO 杨宇欣语气笃定。</p><p>日前，黑芝麻智能于其机器人平台产品发布会上正式官宣布局机器人业务，推出业界首个机器人商业化专属部署平台——SesameX™多维具身智能计算平台，包含Kalos（视觉驱动）、Aura（感控协同）、Liora（认知进化）三大核心模块，已应用于物流车、四足机器人等场景。</p><p>对于此次机器人平台的布局，杨宇欣明确表示，这并非跨界之举，而是业务的自然延伸。据雷峰网了解，黑芝麻智能的机器人业务在2024年底启动，截至目前已有多个项目成功落地。该业务在公司整体营收中占比仍较低，尚处于战略布局阶段，但却是其从智能汽车计算芯片向全域智能计算平台拓展的关键里程碑。</p><p>黑芝麻智能坚定扮演 “赋能者” 角色，它并未选择亲自下场造机器人，短期内也无专为机器人研发芯片的计划，而是立足芯片主业，最大限度复用智驾领域的技术与生产经验，在工具链、IO 等维度适配现阶段机器人客户的场景需求。</p><p>从商业落地来看，黑芝麻智能为机器人业务线锚定了 “",
