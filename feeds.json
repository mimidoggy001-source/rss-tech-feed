    "summary": "<p>在多步时间序列预测任务中，预测性能随时间步长迅速退化几乎成为一种共识。例如：在气象预测中，短期的温度变化能够较为准确地刻画，但当预测跨度扩展至数日甚至一周时，预测误差就会逐渐放大，周期与趋势结构逐渐偏离真实轨迹。类似的问题在金融价格走势和电力负荷预测等场景中也广泛存在。</p><p>无论模型结构如何变化，当预测范围从短期扩展至中长期时，误差积累、趋势漂移和结构失真往往不可避免地出现。这类现象在实践中被频繁观察，却通常被视为模型表达能力或依赖建模不足的直接结果。</p><p>然而，与模型结构持续演进形成鲜明对比的是，多步预测在训练阶段所使用的损失函数却长期保持固定。大多数方法仍以逐时间点的均方误差（MSE）作为优化目标，默认将未来不同预测步视为相互独立且重要性一致的预测对象。</p><p>但是，多步预测并非一组彼此独立的回归任务，未来不同时间点之间往往呈现显著的相关性；此外，不同预测步在优化阶段的重要性也并不相同。若损失函数无法显式刻画这些结构特征，模型在长期预测中出现系统性偏差便并非偶然，而是训练阶段错误假设的自然结果。</p><p>正是在这一背景下，林宙辰团队提出了题为《Qua",
