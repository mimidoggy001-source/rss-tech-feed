    "summary": "<p>从走路、跳舞到后空翻，动作模仿教会了机器人「怎么动」，而到端盘子、分拣水果、热食物等复杂操作时，机器人不能只模仿，更要识别复杂环境，理解「为什么做」的任务意图，再转化为「动手这么做」的连贯操作。</p><p>人类的行动，一般都依托于上下文和意图，核心就在于推理。对机器人而言，尽管大规模互联网数据让GPT、DeepSeek等AI具备了不错的推理能力，但让AI在真实物理世界里通过推理“准确动起来”，特别是处理多步骤长时序任务、模糊指令、未见过情景时，依然挑战重重。</p><p>主流视觉-语言-动作VLA模型依赖&quot;轨迹记忆&quot;，通过海量数据学习&quot;看到A+听到B→做C&quot;的映射。这种方式在标准场景表现尚可，但在开放环境中会暴露三大缺陷：抽象概念失效，比如理解&quot;可乐&quot;，却不懂什么是&quot;补充能量的饮料&quot;；环境泛化困难，如白桌训练、到木桌失效；长时序任务崩溃，比如微波炉加热需多步连贯操作，一步出错则全盘皆输。</p><p>AI机器人公司星尘智能提出<strong>端到端全身VLA模型——Lumo-1，旨在让机器人心手合一",
