    "summary": "<p>大语言模型的能力在不断增强，但幻觉问题仍然是横亘在现实应用前的一道关键障碍。</p><p>即便在有文档和检索结果作为依据的情况下，模型仍可能生成与事实不符、缺乏依据甚至与原文相矛盾的内容，而且表达通常流畅、自洽，不易被发现。这对法律、医疗、金融、检索增强生成等对可靠性要求极高的场景带来了明显风险。</p><p>虽然业内不断通过“做更大的模型”“更复杂的检索”“更强的安全对齐”等方式来缓解问题，但成本与算力需求持续攀升，而幻觉为何产生、如何系统检测与解释，依然缺乏有效答案。</p><p>在这样的背景下，清华大学孙茂松团队联合深言科技提出了新论文《FaithLens: Training Large Language Models to Detect Hallucinations with Useful Explanations》。这项工作不再把幻觉检测看成简单的对错分类，而是把它提升为对模型推理过程与证据一致性的整体评估。</p><p>FaithLens 的核心思路是：模型不仅需要判断是否存在幻觉，还要生成清晰、具体、真正能帮助另一个模型做出正确判断的解释，并把这种“解释是否有用”直",
