    "summary": "<p>近期，欧盟理事会正式通过决议，拟提前两年取消150欧元以下进口小额包裹的关税豁免，最快于2026年生效。与此同时，每个进口包裹将额外收取约2欧元的处理费，用于支付清关和检验成本。</p><p>这一政策调整，将直接冲击依赖低价小包的跨境平台和卖家。根据欧盟统计，2024年有46亿件低价值包裹进入欧盟，其中91%来自中国。</p><p>这一举措与今年上半年美国取消T86的做法如出一辙。雷峰网了解到，当时Temu美国被迫紧急提价，全托管模式前端价格直接上涨20%，半托管模式下单件产品价格增加0.3至0.6美金，导致短期单量出现大幅下滑。</p><p>如今面对欧洲即将税改，跨境小包的日子同样不好过。卖家关林算了一笔账，“过去一单售价€12.9的蓝牙耳机，刨去成本和运费，能有¥8利润；如今新政叠加处理费后，若维持原价则亏损，若提价至€16.9，转化率直接腰斩。”（如你也面临相似境遇，欢迎添加微信&nbsp;xl120429&nbsp;交流。）</p><p>在此背景下，一个关键问题浮出水面：当免税红利彻底终结，平台靠什么守住欧洲市场？而数以万计依赖小包生存的中小卖家，又是否还有转型窗口？</",
